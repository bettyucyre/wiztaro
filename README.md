<p>Getting banned from Wizard101 can feel like your magic wand just snapped in half—frustrating and honestly, kind of unfair if you think it was a mistake. This simple guide will help you figure out what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal your ban so you can get back to blasting spells and collecting those rare pets.</p>
<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did you get banned right after making a new account, or does the ban follow you from account to account? You might be <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Wizard101 has flagged your PC hardware, so even new accounts won’t undo the curse.</p>

<p>Using an HWID spoofer might just be the magic potion you need to get back in the game if you’re hit with a hardware ban.</p>
